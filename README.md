# EndlessRunner

 I tried making a very simple flappy bird like endless runner, but instead of the characters bouncing, you have complete control over them; and also there are projectiles.

 I had a lot of trouble with this assignment since for some reason Live Coding was not working and I didn't know how to fix it and I couldn't really get help with it until very recently, so the majority of it is made using blueprints, and then I added a simple scoring system at the end (when Live Coding finally started working again) with c++. 

Controls;
WASD for player 1 (red ball)
Arrow keys for player 2 (blue ball)

Each player has 3 lives which they lose upon hitting the pipes and the scoring is based on how long the player is alive and slowly multiplies the longer it goes.
